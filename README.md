This repository contains the raw data and the implemented parameter estimation workflow of the manuscript 'EnzymeML-based modeling workflow - from raw data acquisition to kinetic parameters'.  
By clicking on the `Colab` badge, a Notebook is started, allowing the comprehensive reanalysis of all data treatment steps of the parameter estimation workflow. The data is this repository is equivalent to the data published on the Dataverse of the University of Stuttgart (`DaRUS`).
